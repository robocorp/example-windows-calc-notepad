# Add numbers in Calculator and save result with Notepad

In this Windows example we'll take the the Calculator and Notepad automation further,
by show-casing how two apps can be operated at the same time, while the data obtained
in one can be extracted and provided to the other.

## How it works

1. Open both Calculator and Notepad apps.
2. Add some numbers in a loop using Calculator.
3. Retrieve the result and place it in the text editor area under Notepad.
4. Save the content in the [*result.txt*](output/result.txt) output file.
5. Close both apps as clean-up.
